hi there, just some `rand()`om guy obsessed with tweaking every little detail mostly in his compter-system..., for no real reason,
wanna contribute to open-source, but that requires *actually finishing things*, maybe... in an alternate timeline where
I have consistency installed.

**camus once said** "One must imagine Sisyphus with a .bashrc file—eternally tweaking, never satisfied, smiling through the syntax errors."
